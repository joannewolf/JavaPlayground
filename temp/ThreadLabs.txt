Thread One
----------

Define a Runnable with a run method that counts from 0 to 9,999 printing the value. ... for (int i = 0; i < 10_000...

Instantiate one of these
Create two Threads based on that one runnable object, start them, observe the output.

----------------

Modify the Runnable so that the variable i is an instance variable, not a local variable
Run it again, observe the effect.

------------------------------------------------------------
Timing One (Bad)

Create one thread; the Runnable "looks at" a boolean value in an external scope (it's shared). When this Runnable starts:
print welcome message, enter "infinite while loop", on exit from loop print message and end.

Main: Create/start thread above. Sleep 1000 milliseconds -- Thread.sleep(ms) then change the boolean value, print a message and exit.

------------------------------------------------------------
Counting
Create TWO instances of a Runnable, the runnable increments a shared data value 100_000 times.

Kick off the two threads sleep for 1 second, then print the resuling value

1) with normal int
2) mark the int "volatile"
